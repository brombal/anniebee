<blockquote>

This sleeping baby caterpillar is Hydrangea's tiny companion, but is equally enticing as an individual doll. This workshop allows the student to make a slightly more detailed version of the caterpillar, with feet. Attention to embellishemtn techniques, from fabric origami to ribbon embroidery and beading are all demonstrated so the students can choose their favorite technique.<p>

<bt>
	<li>easy construction techniques; the "body wrapping" technique used can be adapted to other cloth dolls
	<li>a great workshop for beginners, but also a great canvas for more advanced embellishment techniques
	<li>both center seam and flat face head constructino are taught
	<li>face painting techniques for center seam heads and three-dimensional face painting for flat-faced heads are demonstrated.
	<li>color coordination discussion and embellishment techniques, with emphasis on finishing and fine detail.
	<li>demonstration of <b>BabyFace Caterpillar</b> variations is included; <b>"Caterpillar Wreath Babies"</b> (caterpillars sleeping in a vine wreath) and <b>caterpillar pin dolls</b> are demonstrated, and all techniques are included in class handouts for students to try at home.

This is a delightful one-day workshop for beginners and a creative canvas for more advanced dollmakers. Almost all supplies, including pre-sewn parts, are included in a $15.00 kit (payable to the instuctor in class) to make this little garden darling. Students are asked to bring a small number of basic supplies and any embellishments they may with to use.<p>
In addition to my usual method of doing faces with gel pens, colored pencils and fabric markers, the class includes the use of <b>rubber stamps</b> and <b>computer printed images</b>. Special emphasis on embellishment techniques are part of this workshop.<p>
The class kit includes the <b>"BabyFace Caterpillar"</b> workbook and use of communal class supplies. If they are available, some items (such as embellishments and extra kits) may be available for purchase in class.<p>
This class will appeal to everyone from beginner to advanced levels. Class enrollment is limited to 20 students. No sewing machine of pre-class work is required. Enrolled students will be sent a small "required supply list" for this workshop.<p>
Knowledge of basic sewing skills and enthusiasm is required for this class. Chocolate and a good sense of humor always helps too!
