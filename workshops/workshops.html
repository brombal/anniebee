<h2><font color="lightgreen">2000/2001 Workshops and Seminars</font></h2>
</center>

<blockquote>
All seminars and workshops are one, two, or three-day events and can be arranged locally in the Dallas area and at more distant locations for your club or group.
<h3>Requirements for teaching at remote locations:</h3><p>

<h4>Transportation costs:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Driving expenses if within a four-hour drive of Dallas, at a standard rate of 30 cents per mile.
	<li>Airline ticket costs if travelling to more distant locations.
	<li>Pickup and drop-off at airports, if required or transfer costs between airport and host location.
</ul><p>

<h4>Room and board for the duration of the workshop/seminar:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Private billeting is great......if you can put up with me, I can put up with you. I have no allergies that I know of and eat just about anything that doesn't move, but you may have to put up with my weird hours......I often like to work late into the night.
	<li>I am also happy with hotel / motel accommodations, if your club prefers to put me somewhere else.
</ul>

<h4>Workshop Fees:</h4>
All workshops and seminars are $280.00 per day, regardless of the number of students. Most clubs or groups share the cost amongst themselves. As an example, a two-day workshop would be $560.00, and if there are ten enrolled students, they would pay $56.00 each as well as any associated kit fees.

<h4>Student Number Limitations:</h4>
Each workshop may have a different maximum number of students, but in general, I like to keep the classes to a maximum of 14 for two and three day workshops, and 20 for one day workshops. Of course, the smaller the number of students, the more individualized the attention. I do not require a minimum number of students for any class; I am happy to teach a single student or a full class. Please contact me if you have special needs for a particular class and I will do my best to accommodate you.

<h4>Other associated costs:</h4>
Some workshops require purchase of specialized kits. Each course description will include a description and price for the kits, if applicable to that particular workshop. Generally, I try to sell the kits at my cost; they are often provided just to ensure that students are all able to use the same materials that I have recommended. More advanced classes such as "Isabel" require special pre-made pieces in order to complete the doll, and these are provided in the purchased class kits. Some classes also have pre-made or pre-painted pieces or doll sections available for purchase. Prices and availability will be outlined in each of the course descriptions

<h4>Pre-Workshop Instructions and Requirements:</h4>
Some classes require preparation work and/or pre-class supply purchases. If this is the case, pre-class instruction and supply sheets will be sent to enrolled students, either individually or by way of a group contact person. If there are questions, my phone number and email address will always be provided for direct contact......I am happy to answer questions regarding the classes at any time.
