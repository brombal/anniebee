This wonderful, colorful lady is an adventure in embellishement and fabric therapy. Made using a candlestick base and internal armature, she is dressed in nine layers of you favorite fabrics and embellished with you most cherished treasures. Instructions for her bejewelled Mardi Gras mask are also a part of this class. The Mardi Gras class features the following techniques:

</bt><p>

On Day One, the emphasis is on creating a needlesculpted face as well as a flat face with a three-dimensional appearance. Both techniques will be demonstrated, and students have a choice of creating the face using the method that appeals to them. In addition to my usual method of doing faces with gel pens, colored pencils and fabric markers, the class includes the use of rubber stamps and an overview of ways to create faces with computer-printed images. For those who consider themselves "artistically challenged," this class will prove that <b>anyone</b> can create a beautiful face. Students are invited to make several heads and choose their favorite to complete the doll with. We will also begin construction of the doll.<p>

Day Two is devoted to body construction of the doll, with emphasis on creating a wire armature that can be adapted to many styles of cloth dolls, button jointing of the arms, creating bendable wired fingers and creating "faux" shoes on cloth legs with paint, glitter and trim. We finish with the customized base construction.<p>

Students need to purchase a $20.00 kit (payable to the instructor on the day of the class) containing candle base, hardware and items related to doll construction, as well as the "Mardi Gras" workbook, and use of communal class supplies such as paint, glitter, and fixative spray. If they are available, some items such as pre-painted heads and overflow raw materials may be available for purchase in class.<p>

Class enrollment is limited to 15 students. The choice of doing pre-class work is left to the student, but dolls are more likely to near completion in class if homework is done beforehand. Enrolled students will be sent a pre-class packet of patterns, instruction and a required supply list.<p>

A sewing machine (in good working order), knowledge of basic sewing skills and a good sense of humor is required for this class.
