<blockquote>

An easy to make, very silly paperweight doll with obvious personality, this "Bosom Buddy" can be made with either "perky" or "droopy" endowment. Delight yourself or your own "Bosom Buddy" with this weighted painted lady who will stand guard over important papers with class!<p>

<bt>
	<li>easy construction techniques; great for beginners, but also a great canvas for more advanced embellishemnt techniques.
	<li>both modern and Victorian style techniques are taught 
	<li>specific Bosom Buddy face painting techniques
	<li>color coordination discussion and embellishment techniques, with emphasis on finishing and fine detail
	<li>demonstration of Bosom Buddy variations; pin dolls, jewellery and card holders are some of the variations on display. These variations will be in the class workbook so the student can try them at home.

This is a delightful one-day workshop for beginners and a creative canvas for more advanced dollmakers. Almost all supplies, including pre-sewn parts, are included in a $15.00 kit (payable to the instructor in class) to make this freestanding paperweight doll.<p>
In addition to my usual method of doing faces with gel pens, colored pencils and fabric markers, the class includes the use of rubber stamps and computer printed images. Special emphasis on embellishment techniques are part of this workshop.<p>
The class kit includes the "Bosom Buddies" workbook (with full color face painting guide and variations on the "Bosom Buddy" theme) and use of communal class supplies. If they are available, some items (such as embellishments and extra kits) may be available for purchase in class.<p>
This class will appeal to everyone from beginner to advanced levels. Class enrollment is limited to 20 students. No sewing machine or pre-class work is required. Enrolled students will be sent a small "required supply list" for this workshop.<p>
Knowledge of basic sewing skills and enthusiasm is required for this class. Chocolate and a good sense of humor always helps too!<p>
