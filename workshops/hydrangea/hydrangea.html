"Hydrangea" is a beautiful and fun-to-make seated and wighted cloth doll for those with basic sewing skills and a desire to learn basic loth dollmaking techniques. A 24-inch beauty, she can also be made without bottom weighting as a lightweight wall-hanging doll.<p>

For those who are looking for more of a dollmaking challenge, she makes a wonderful canvas to show off favorite embillishment techniques like quilting and piecework, embroidery, beading or even fabric origami. Her overcoat is a perfect background for the fabric origame embellishments which create the flowers that give this "Butterfly Mama" her name.

This class will appeal to everyone from beginners who are looking to gain knowledge of basic cloth dollmaking techniques, to advanced dollmakers who are looking for a lovely doll to act as a canvas for more detailed embellishment techniques. Hydrangea and her Baby Caterpillar will appeal especially to those who love winged creatures.<p>

<b>On Day One</b>, we devote ourselves to creating a beautiful Hydrangea face, and we start construction of the body. Legs with bare feet or fancy shoes, and lovely hands with three-dimensional fingernails should be finished on the first day.<p>

<b>Day Two</b> is devoted to completing the body construction, adding a hairstyle and creating wings.<p>

<b>Optional Day Three (Baby Caterpillar)</b> is devoted to creating Hydrangea's tiny sleeping friend, through body wrapping techniques and embellishment. A separate kit fee of $15.00 will supply the student with a caterpillar kit containing almost everything needed to create Baby Caterpillar; students only need to bring embellishments and a few other supplies. (A suggested list of embellishments and a detailed supply list will be provided to enrolled students.) Extra Caterpillar kits may be available in class.<P>

<b>For the Hydrangea Class only:<br></b>
Students must purchase a $20.00 class kit (payable to the instructor on the day of the class) which will include armature supplies, the "Hydrangea" workbook, and use of communal class supplies such as paint, glitter and fixative spray. If they are available, some items such as pre-painted heads and overflow raw materials may be available for purchase in class.<p>

Class enrollment is limited to 15 students. The choice of doing pre-class work is left to the student, but dolls are more likely to near completion in class if homework is done beforehand. Enrolled students will be sent a pre-class packet of patterns, instruction and a required supply list.<p>

A sewing machine (in good working order), knowledge of basic sewing skills and a good sense of humor is required for this class. Chocolate is always good too!<p>
