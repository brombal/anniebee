Angels are among us. Pay homage to those who protect us with this delicate wall hanging or ornament. Measuring 12 inches from wing tip to wing tip, this simple hanging angel head doll is another great way to show off your embellishment skills. Lots of beading tips and techniques are included in this class.<p>

This is a delightful one-day workshop for beginners and a creative canvas for more advanced dollmakers. Almost all supplies, including pre-sewn parts, are included in a $15.00 kit (payable to the instructor in class) to make this celestial sweetheart. Students are asked to bring a small number of basic supplies and any special embellishments they may wish to use.<p>
In addition to my usual method of doing faces with gel pens, colored pencils and fabric markers, the class includes the use of rubber stamps and computer printed images. Special emphasis on embellishment techniques are part of this workshop.<p>
The class kit includes the "Angel Face" workbook and use of communal class supplies. If they are available, some items (such as embellishments and extra kits) may be available for purchase in class.<p>
This class will appeal to everyone from beginner to advanced levels. Class enrollment is limited to 20 students. No sewing machine or pre-class work is required. Enrolled students will be sent a small "required supply list" for this workshop.<p>
Knowledge of basic sewing skills and enthusiasm is required for this class. Chocolate and a good sense of humor always helps too!<p>
