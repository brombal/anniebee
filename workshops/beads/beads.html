</center>
<blockquote>

This is not so much an individual workshop for dollmakers, but rather a special optional day which can be added to any workshop. In this class, students learn couched beading techniques which can be used to create special embellishments for dolls, personal jewellery, beautiful wearable pieces for themselves, or even beaded medallions for ornaments and decorative purposes.<p>
These beaded medallions can be used as headpieces or embellishments for dolls, and can be seen on the "Women of Empowerment" Chatelaine, and the Angel Face dolls.<p>

<bt>
	<li>easy enough for beginners, but also a great learning experience in flat surface beading techniques for more advanced dollmakers; a great class for anyone who loves "fiddly suff"
	<li>all work is done by hand, no sewing machine is required for this class
	<li>detailed instruction on couch beaded medallions (beaded non-loom flat work), including edge finishing and bead stringing techniques.
	<li>techniques are geared toward the project that the class is making
	<li>we use buttons, beads, jewels and other flat back cabochons to create unique medallion centerpieces
</bt><p>

Students need to purchase a $10.00 class kit (payable to the instructor on the day of the class) which includes beading needles, beading thread, felt and ultrasuede backing. If they are available, some items (such as beads, cabochons, flat back stones, etc.) may be available for purchase in class.<P>

This class will appeal to everyone from beginner to advanced levels. Class enrollment is limited to 20 students. No sewing machine or pre-class work is required. Entolled students will be sent a "required supply list" for this workshop, and students must be prepared to bring a selection of buttons, beads and other flat-backed stones and jewels. Start your search now!<p>

Knowledge of basic sewing skills and enthusiasm is required for this class. Chocolate and a good sense of humor always helps too! Don't forget to bring your glasses if you need them......this is very detailed work!<p>
