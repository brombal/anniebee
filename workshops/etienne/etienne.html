<blockquote>

Designed as a freestanding doll on a "floating" base, "Etienne" is a magical modular doll with a distinctly exotic flvor. An adventure in fabric therapy and sumptuous embellishment, she gracefully flaunts her continental style, and can be easily converted to a wall hanging doll. This is a two-day class which covers a wide range of techniques including: 

<bt>
	<li>special full head, flat-face head construction
	<li>painting techniques specialized to create three-dimensional effects on flat surfaces
	<li>modular doll construction techniques with becdable neck/body armature that can be adapted to many other styles of cloth dolls
	<li>color coordination discussion and embellishment techniques, with emphasis on finishing and fine detail
	<li>optional machine-quilted angel or fairy wing construction
	<li>base construction demonstration
</bt><p>

On Day One, the emphasis is on creating a flat face with a three-dimensional appearance. In addition to my usual method of doing faces with gel pens, colored pencils and fabric markers, the class includes the use of rubber stamps and an overview of ways to create faces with computer-printed images. For those who consider themselves "artistically challenged", this class will prove that <i>anyone</i> can create a beautiful face. Students are invited to make several heads and choose their favorite to complete the doll with. We will also begin construction of the doll.<p>

Day Two is devoted to construction of the modular doll, with emphasis on creating a wire armature that can be adapted to many styles of cloth dols, button jointing of the arms, creating bendable wired fingers with three-dimensional fingernails and creating "faux" shoes on cloth legs with paint, glitter and trim. We finish with a demonstration of the base construction; students are welcome to attempt to create the base if time allows.<p>

<B>**Please note:</B><br>
An optional second day can be added to this class; See <a href="../beads/beads.html">"Beaded Embellishent Adventures"</a> for details about this special day of beaded embellishment techniques.<br>
<hr><p>

Students must purchase a $20.00 class kit (payable to the instructor on the day of the class) which will include armature supplies, the "Etienne" workbook (with full color face painting guide) and use of communal class supplies such as paint, glitter and fixative sprays. If they are available, some items (such as supplies for base construction, pre-painted heads and overflow raw materials) may be available for purchase in class.<p>

This is a delightful one-day workshop for beginners and a creative canvas for more advanced dollmakers. Almost all supplies, including pre-sewn parts, are included in a $15.00 kit (payable to the instructor in class) to make this freestanding paperweight doll.<p>

In addition to my usual method of doing faces with gel pens, colored pencils and fabric markers, the class includes the use of rubber stamps and computer printed images. Special emphasis on embellishment techniques are part of this workshop.<p>

The class kit includes the "Bosom Buddies" workbook (with full color face painting guide and variations on the "Bosom Buddy" theme) and use of communal class supplies. If they are available, some items (such as embellishments and extra kits) may be available for purchase in class.<p>

This class will appeal to everyone from beginner to advanced levels. Class enrollment is limited to 15 students. The choice of doing pre-class work is left to the student, but dolls are more likely to near completion in class if homework is done beforehand. Enrolled students will be sent a pre-class packet of patterns, instructions and a required supply list. A sewing machine (in good working order), knowledge of basic sewing skills and enthusiasm is required for this class. Chocolate and a good sense of humor always helps too!<p>
