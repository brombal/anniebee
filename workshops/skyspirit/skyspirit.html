<blockquote>

Inspired by eastern European folklore, Anne-Marie has reached back into her colorful ethnic heritage and turned a fondly remembered and cherished childhood tale into a graceful doll. The "Sky Spirit" is a mythical creature that lives in the clouds and comes to earth with the rain, to replenish the colors of a dry and parched earth. As she returns to the sky after the rains, she leaves her colors behind and appears as a figure in black and white. The complete "Tale of the Sky Spirit" is included in the class kit as a very special keepsake book.<p>

Designed as a wall hanging doll, the Sky Spirit is a 16-inch doll, made with a pre-formed face (two faces are supplied to students in their kits). An original sculpt by the artist, the face has been delicately reproduced in papier mache, and can be finished in a variety of techniques, including cloth overlay, gold leafing, antiquing, burnishing and even decoupage. Students choose their own finishing techniques to try, with many samples available to inspect. This two-day class covers a variety of techniques:<p>

<bt>
	<li>using papier mache masks for dollmaking
	<li>a variety of finishing techniques for the papier mache mask
	<li>color coordination discussion with emphasis on quality doll construction techniques
	<li>embellishment techniques, with special attention to fine detail and finishing<p>
</bt>

On Day One, the emphasis is on creating and finishing a face using the supplied masks. A variety of techniques will be demonstrated and students will be able to try several of their favorites. With the body construction started, we will attach faces to heads and discuss moldmaking for those who have an interest in creating their own papier mache masks for dolls.<p>

Day Two is devoted to construction of the doll, with emphasis on creating the neck/body armature, attachment and positioning of the arms, making posable wired hands and realistic cloth feet. Hands and feet have three-dimensional nails.<p>

Students must purchase a $20.00 class kit (payable to instructor in class), which will include two papier mache faces, armature supplies, some embellishments, and use of all painting/finishing supplies. The kits also include the "Sky Spirit" workbook and the "Tales of the Sky Spirit" story book. If they are available, extra  items such as molded faces and embellishments may be available for purchase in class.<p>

Class enrollment is limited to 15 students. The choice of doing pre-class work is left to the student, but dolls are more likely to near completion in class if homework is done beforehand. Enrolled students will be sent a pre-class packet of patterns, instruction and a required supply list.<p>

This class will appeal to everyone from beginner to advanced dollmaking levels. Basic sewing skills, a sewing machine in good working order, and enthusiasm are required for this class. Chocolate for the instructor will accumulate brownie points for students.<p>
