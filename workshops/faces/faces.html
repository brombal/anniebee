<h2>"A Day at the Faces" Workshop</h2><p>
<h3>One-Day Workshop / All Skill Levels<br>
*Can be modified to a four-gour workshop; please ask for details*</h3></font><p>
</center>

Students get two pre-stuffed heads (each a different shape) and we paint faces, 'a la Annie', for the day. Using gel pens, 
colored pencils, fabric pens and glitter, we work on face drawing and coloring techniques. Students are welcome to bring 
more heads, as well as their own collection of favorite face-painting supplies. There is a required kit purchase, which 
includes the pre-made heads, as well as a choice of one of my workbook-style patterns which can be used to complete a doll. 
(There is also an <b>optional</b> kit available to students who wish to own the same items that I use to create my faces.)<p>
