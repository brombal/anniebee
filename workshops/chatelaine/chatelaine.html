<blockquote>

This magnificent embellished chatelaine is a combination of three-dimensional face painting and couched medallion beading techniques. For those who would like to learn or practice three-dimensional face painting techniques, as well as for those who want to expand their knowledge of beaded embellishment, this magnificent bag is a wearable work of art displaying your talents. When you aren't wearing it, you can display it proudly it on a wall.<p>

<bt>
	<li>easy enough for beginners, but also a great learning experience in couched beading techniques for more advanced dollmakers
	<li>detailed instruction on three-dimensional face painting on a flat surface (two blank faces are supplied in the class kit)
	<li>demonstration of other faces used by the artist for this project; sculpted polymer clay faces have been reproduced in resin and papier mache and are shown and techniques are described in detail. Extra faces will be for sale in class, if they are available.
	<li>bag construction is demonstrated, but pre-sewn bags (made in sumptuous fabrics) are included in the class kit; no sewing machine is required for this class
	<li>detailed instruction on couched beaded medallions, including edge finishing and bead stringing techniques.
	<li>demonstration of the "Women of Empowerment" chatelaine with wearable jewellery, for the two-day workshop<p>

<B>**Please note:</B><br>
There is an optional third day for this workshop, where students create removable beaded medallions and earrings instead of the permanently attached beaded medallion. This allows the student to wear the beaded pieces as individual jewellery. Please request the "Women of Empowerment" Chatelaine Workshop with wearable jewellery.
<hr><p>

This is an intensive two-day workshop aimed at learning both three-dimensional face painting and detailed couched beading techniques. We use buttons, beads, jewels and other flat back cabochons to create a unique medallion centerpiece for your bag. The ornate medallion sets off the beautiful center "power face", to create a lovely work of art in which to store your favorite tiny treasures, including pictures of the grandkids and your credit card.<p>

In addition to my usual method of doing faces with gel pens, colored pencils and fabric markers, the class includes the use of rubber stamps and computer printed images. Students with a "fear of faces" will love this easy method of creating a beautiful face.<p>

Students must purchase a $15.00 class kit (payable to the instructor on the day of the class) which will include a pre-sewn bag, two pre-made flat faces, the "Women of Empowerment"  workbook and use of communal class supplies. If they are available, some items (such as pre-painted cloth faces or resin / papier mache faces) may be available for purchase in class.<p>

This class will appeal to everyone from beginner to advanced levels. Class enrollment is limited to 20 students. No sewing machine or pre-class work is required. Enrolled students will be sent a "required supply list" for this workshop, and students must be prepared to bring a selection of buttons, beads and other flat-backed stones and jewels. Start your search now!<p>

Knowledge of basic sewing skills and enthusiasm is required for this class. Chocolate and a good sense of humor always helps too!
