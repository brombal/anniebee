"Peony", and her tiny sleeping caterpillar companion "Little Fuschia" are made using the "Hydrangea" pattern, using 
different fabrics and trims. The fabric origami flowers on her jacket are made to resemble peony petals.<p>

Perhaps you'd like to see Peony's sister doll <a href="hydrangea.html">"Hydrangea"</a> or her cousin

Different selections in materials and colors allow you to customize these dolls to any whim. The information 
on this pattern can be found on the <a href="hydrangea.html">"Hydrangea"</a> page, or you 
can <a href="mailto:anniebee@ticnet.com">email me</a> directly for more information.<br clear="all"><br>
