"Bluebell" is made using the "Hydrangea" pattern, using different fabrics and trims, and with a lovely floral 
head embellishment.<p>

Perhaps you'd like to see Bluebell's sister doll <a href="hydrangea.html">"Hydrangea"</a> or her
cousin <a href="Peony.html">"Peony"</a>? 

Different selections in fabrics, colors and trims allow you to customize these dolls to any whim. The information 
for ordering the "Hydrangea" pattern can be found on the <a href="hydrangea.html">"Hydrangea"</a> 
page, or you can <a href="mailto:anniebee@ticnet.com"> email me</a> directly for more information.<p>

"Bluebell" was part of the exhibit and she was also my centerpiece raffle doll at the final banquet at Doll U in 
Oakland California this past September. She and her little companion caterpillar "Little Blue Twinkle" were won by 
a member of the Dallas Ditzy Doll Tarts, my own cloth doll club. (No.....I didn't fix it that way....it just 
happened that way....honest!)<br clear="all"><br>
