<h3>
In May, 1999, several members of the Dallas Ditzy Doll Tarts managed to make their way to Tulsa, OK 
to attend an intensive workshop with none other than elinor peace bailey. The guest of honor was 
resplendent in her usual finery, complete with purple hair and a vest covered with pin dolls. She has 
since written references to us in her newsletter, but we aren't sure if she was happy to have us there
or happy to see the backs of us! From this humble beginning, at a weekend workshop with elinor,
came the start of the "Dolling Dames", Tulsa's fledgling cloth doll club. elinor showed us her 
soon-to-be-released designs for the Bernina embroidery machines as well as her art quilt that she 
has been working on. For many of us, it was our first opportunity to experience a workshop with the 
diva of the cloth doll world herself!

Every once in a while she could be seen trying to make her point a little more adamantly than usual.
