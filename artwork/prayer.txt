"A Prayer for My Teacher"
We thank You dear Jesus, every day
For those who can teach us and show us the way.
Often times, it's a treacherous path
Through spelling and reading and writing and math.
We do try our best Lord to pay them some heed......
A good teacher's job is a hard one indeed!
And so many times in the course of the day,
Our bright little minds will just wander away.

Off to the fields where the wildflowers bloom,
Home where the toys lie in wait in our room,
Just out the window to watch the birds fly,
Wondering how they can soar up so high.

Help us dear Jesus to learn all that we may
From these angels who tend to our minds everyday.
Give them the patience and courage and zest
To nurture our souls and to bring out the best

In a child who is open to every new thought,
Or a child who just may not want to be taught.
Give them the strength to remember their goals,
To patiently teach us while touching our souls.

And help us remember with each passing day,
All that we learn from them, this Lord we pray.
Grant us the knowledge that opens all doors,
When You hold my teacher's hand, I'm holding Yours.
