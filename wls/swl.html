<font color="lightgreen" size=6><b>My Final Weight Loss Adventure.....<br>Success via Surgery</b></font><p>
</center>


This is the story, in pictures and in words, of how I lost 180 lbs. 
After a lifetime of being seriously overweight and the continuous struggle
to lose 200 lbs., I chose to have solve the problem via a specialized
surgical procedure known as a distal Roux-en-Y divided gastric bypass. This was 
performed by Dr. Peter Bistolarides at the Bariatric Treatment Center in Addison, Michigan 
in December of 1997. To him, I remain eternally grateful.....I have regained my
self respect, my health and my ability to play an active role in life.<p>
