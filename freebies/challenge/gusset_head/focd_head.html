<H2>Directions for making the head with the chin gusset.....</H2><p>


Locate your three "head" pattern pieces and cut them out according to the pattern 
indicators.<br>
You should have a head "front (one piece), a head back (two pieces), and 
a head "gusset" (one piece).<p>

When the head "front piece is opened out, it should look like this:<p>

Mark the center at the bottom chin area with a small dot.<p>

With the right sides together, stitch the center seam of the head front, using a 
small stitch length; usually 15 to 20 stitches per inch will provide good strength 
for a seam that will be supporting tight stuffing.<p>

When stitched, clip the curve. It should then look like this:<p>

Stitch a small amount of polyfil into the seam at the nose area, going over the 
first line of stitching.<br>

Find the head "gusset" piece. Opened out, this piece looks like this:<p>

Mark the center at the bottom chin area of the gusset with a small dot.<p>

Place the stitched "head front" and the "head gusset" right sides together.<br>
Match the dots and baste the two pieces into position as shown:<p>

Stitch together using a small stitch setting again, 15 to 20 stitches per inch.<br>
Remove basting stitches if necessary and clip the curve.<p>

This is now your "head front / gusset" section.<p>

Find the two "head back" pieces, and stitch the center seam, again using tight stitching; 
15 to 20 stitches per inch.<br>

Clip the curve and open out the section.<p>

Take the previously stitch "head front / gusset" section, and the "head back" section, and position 
them right sides together.<br>
Baste the two sections into position.<br>
At the top of the head, on one side, stitch a seam that goes from the top edge to 
a spot about one inch above the lower center back seam.<br>
End your seam and repeat, starting at the top edge on the other side.<br>
You will have left an opening at the bottom of the head, for insertion of the finished neck tab 
on the doll body.<p>

It should now look like this:<p>

<img src="gusset_head_backtofront.jpg" width="219" height="237"><p>

Remove basting stitches if necessary.<p> 

From the side, the head, which is now ready to turn right side out, should look like 
this:<p>

Clip curves and turn the head right side out.<p>

Fold the top edge of the head under and use button and craft thread, or dental floss to 
make a strong gathering line.<br>
Before gathering, stuff the head lightly, with just enough 
polyfil to give the head shape.<br>
You don't want to put too much stuffing in at this point.<br> 
Once the head has a shape, pull the gathering tightly and tie it off.<br>
Secure with a few extra good, strong stitches so it won't break if you plan to stuff the head tightly.<p>

This is what the completed head should look like, turned right side out (before you 
finish stuffing it):<p>

Once you have tied off the top of the head, stuff tightly from the bottom opening.<br>
Use your fingers and then use something smaller, like hemostats, as you position smaller bits 
of polyfil into the head.<br>
Maintain the neck opening by checking that your thumb fits into it.<br>
This is where the neck stump of the doll body goes, and you want it to stay open as 
you stuff the head into a nice shape.<br>
I like to stuff fairly tightly, but not so tight as to prevent me from doing some needlesculpting
if I want to.<p>

Since this is your interpretation, feel free to stuff the head the way any way you want 
to!<p>

And don't forget to have fun!
