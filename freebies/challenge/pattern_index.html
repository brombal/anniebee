<H1><font color="lightgreen">This is the FOCD Challenge Doll Index Page...<p></h1>
<h2>(This is page 1)<p></font></h2>
Click on each of the following pages to collect all of the pattern pieces for your doll.
There is a one-inch line printed on each page to use as a guide....this will allow you to judge whether you have a copy that is
the same size as the original pattern, as well as an indicator of whether all of the pages have printed equal in size.
If you are having trouble printing the pattern (cut off edges, missing sections, etc.), use the guidelines below to help you. If 
you are still unable to print the pattern properly, please email me at <a href="mailto:anniebee@ticnet.com">anniebee@ticnet.com</a> and I will be happy to send them to 
you as attachments or via snail mail.<p>
As you print each page, you will need to hit the "back" button on your browser to return here to the index page.<p>

(With gratitude to Hilary Berzins of England, who gave this to me, for I am one of the truly mathematically challenged of the world....)<br>
	
1. Print out your pattern.<br>
2. Measure the inch line in fractions of an inch.<br>
3. Turn your fraction upside down.<br>
4. Multiply by 100 to turn it into a percentage.<p>

Example:<br>
Your line measures 3/4 inch<br>
Turn it upside down<br>     
(4/3 = 1.333333)<br>
Multiply by 100<br>         
(133%)<br>
(3/4 x 4/3 x 100 = 100% which is full size)<br><br><br><br>
