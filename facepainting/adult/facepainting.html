<b>Drawing the Basic Face Outline</b><p>

Use the sample face drawing guide above to help you decide what kind of facial features to put on your doll, or use your imagination to create a face of your own.<P>

Outline the features lightly, using a brown gel pen or, if you are a bit timid, a sharp pencil. Using a pencil will allow you to gently erase anything you aren't happy with, using a kneadable art eraser.<P>

Draw only the outline of the eye; leave the inner eye details (the iris and pupil) until later.<P>

Lightly draw in the nose, mouth, eyebrows, and smaller details such as the philtrum (the little depression just below the nose), small creases below the inner corners of the eyes, and anything else that might add to the character of the face.<P>

<b>Getting the Eyes Started</b><p>

<img src="face painting_2.jpg" align="left" width="210" height="308">
Start by filling in the area that represents the whites of the eyes, with a white DecoFabric marker. If you can't find one of these wonderful white fabric pens at your local arts and crafts supply store, you can use a small paintbrush and paint the area with  off-white or cream colored acrylic paint (pure white is too stark, especially on darker skinned dolls). Let the whites of the eyes dry well before attempting to do any coloring of the iris.<p>
	<center><img src="face painting_2a.jpg" width="279" height="131"></center><p>
Use the brown gel pen and create more solid definition in the other lines: add more color to the eyebrows, the nose and any other facial lines. From experience, the gel pens will go onto the fabric very strongly, but then the color will fade back and lighten up, so I always find myself going back and reapplying the lines to keep them strong. Much of my work is layered, as I find myself checking and rechecking lines and areas that I have already done, and then adding to those areas to ensure that they don't fade away.<br clear="ALL"><br>

<b>Detailing the Eyes and Lips</b><p>

<img src="face painting_3.jpg" align="left" width="215" height="309">
Because you are working on fabric, any paint that is applied tends to raise the fibers of the cloth. These fibers dry erratically and have a tendency to stick up and prevent the smooth application of the pens and pencils. The white area needs to be smoothed down before you can do a good job of coloring the irises.<p>

When the whites of the eyes have dried really well, use a corner of your sanding block to smooth the white area. Use a gentle circular motion and smooth out the entire white area. Wipe away any dust that you create. Use a cotton cloth to lightly polish the white area that you have smoothed down.<P>

Use a brown gel pen to re-outline the eye area. Redefine the eye by using a burgundy gel pen to make the upper eyelid area more obvious. The eyes I create are quite heavily defined, but keep in mind that even though the eyes are strongly outlined, don't go overboard.<P>

Draw the irises now. Make a circle in each eye with a gel pen in your chosen eye color. If you are making blue eyes, use a dark blue gel pen for the outline. If you are making green eyes, you can use green or even brown to define the edge of the iris.<p>

<img src="face painting_4.jpg" align="left" width="217" height="311">
When coloring the iris, you are going to create a darker area at the top of the circle, fading to a lighter shade as you move down to the bottom of the eye. Start with a gel pen in your chosen eye color and fill in a the top third of the iris, just below the upper eyeliner.<p>

<img src="face painting_5.jpg" align="left" width="214" height="305">
Use a dampened white watercolor pencil in the lower part of the iris to create the variation in color. Blend the wet watercolor pencil into the gel pen color, a bit at a time. Work slowly and carefully, shading the iris from dark at the top, to lighter at the bottom. Let the colors dry slightly, and then add a second application of the wet watercolor pencil in the lower iris. This will create an even more distinct gradient of color. Once your shading is completed, redefine the outer edge of the iris with the gel pen if you need to.<p>

<img src="face painting_6.jpg" align="left" width="225" height="318">
Let the iris color dry well before making the black pupil. When the iris has dried, use a black fabric marker or a black gel pen to create the pupil. Make it large enough to give the impression that the doll is interested in the world around her.<p>

<img src="face painting_7.jpg" align="left" width="223" height="316">
Research has shown that when we interact with each other, our pupils enlarge if we are interested in what the other person has to say. If you make the pupil too small, she will either look like she's bored, she's taking mind-altering medication, or she's related to a parakeet. Try to make both pupils the same size. If you have trouble with circles, invest in a circle template. These little plastic wonders make life easier for many of us!<p>

Use your brown gel pen and create a small "tear duct" in the inside corner of each eye. Use a pink fabric marker to add a tiny bit of rosy color to the tear duct.<p>

Fill in the lips with a pink or peach FabricMate marker, or do a base coat of one color and a second coat of the other color. I like to layer one color on top of the other. I have found that each color on its own is too strong, but the combination works well for me. You may need to play with the colors a bit to find the shading that you prefer.<br clear="ALL"><br>

<img src="face painting_8.jpg" align="left" width="225" height="315">
While the area is still wet from the marker(s), fill the center of the lower lip with a white watercolor pencil.<br clear="ALL"><br>

	<center><img src="../../bar.gif" width="427" height="32"></center><p>

<img src="face painting_9.jpg" align="left" width="225" height="320">
The idea here is to have the lower, fuller lip appear as though it is catching the light. The lower lip should be lighter than the upper lip, giving the viewer the impression that it is rounded and a little pouty. The white highlighting will accomplish that.<p>

Wet the watercolor pencil if you need to get richer color onto the center of the lower lip. A few heavier spots of white on the lower lip will give it just a bit of sparkle.<p>

Add extra color to the upper lip with another layer of fabric pen or colored pencil. The upper lip should be darker and look like it is in more of a shadow. Now you need to redo the brown outline of the lips. The fabric markers will have dulled the color and the strength of the lines, so go over them again very carefully, making sure that the lines remain thin. Use a gentle touch.<br clear="ALL"><br>

<b>Adding the Color to the Face</b><p>

<img src="face painting_10.jpg" align="left" width="225" height="327">This is the time to start creating depth in the face. Using a terra cotta colored pencil, color in areas that would be recessed on a human face; that is, areas like the sides of the nose, just below the lower lip, in the corners of the mouth (a very important area for shadows!) and in the creases of the eyelids. You need to put the color onto the fabric fairly heavily, but don't be alarmed if it looks odd; you are going to blend the color in and soften it out.<p>
	<center><img src="face painting_10a.jpg" width="274" height="128"></center><p>
Leave the very center area just above the iris (and below the eyebrow) unshaded. This will make the area look like it has a lighted glow, which we will more heavily accentuate later with a white or light color pencil.<br clear="ALL"><br>

	<center><img src="../../bar.gif" width="427" height="32"></center><p>

<img src="face painting_11.jpg" align="left" width="241" height="331">
Use a stump blender to blend the shadow colors that you have put into the recessed areas. Rub the pointed end of the stump into the color and work it into the fabric. You will remove some of the color, lightening it a bit.<p>

A stump blender is an art tool that is actually a tightly rolled wad of paper with a sharpened end. It's official name is from the French; it's called a "tortillon", which, of course, means "tightly rolled up wad of paper". It can be sharpened like a pencil when it gets dull, or rubbed along a fingernail sanding block (available at any drug store, in the section where you get nail supplies). You need to be careful when moving from one color to another; you don't want to mistakenly lay down color that hasn't been cleaned off of your stump blender. I keep my sanding block with my stump blender to remove all traces of the last color that I worked with. Just sand the tip of the stump blender any time you need to.<p>

You can also use a blending pencil. These pencils are available in the same area where the colored pencils are found (and usually in the same display), in the art supply section of your favorite craft store. They are mainly wax and can be used to smooth out and spread color on the fabric. Some colored pencil sets will include a blending pencil.<p>

In the area of the eyelid crease, lay the color down so that it's reasonably rich and thick. Follow the line of the eyelid as a guide, but go above the actual line a bit. Use a darker brown, or be a little bolder and use a touch of dark green or dark blue. If the eyelid line disappears under the colored pencil, redraw the line with your brown gel pen.<p>

<img src="face painting_12.jpg" align="left" width="242" height="341">
Use the terra cotta pencil to add shadow to the upper left forehead and below the chin. Use the side of the pencil to add color to these larger areas.<p>

Use a small piece of felt (try a piece that's about 2 inches 3 inches), folded in half, to rub across the colored area and blend it into the fabric so that no streaks or stark edges remain. You will use this felt pad to blend colors in the cheeks later. Use a folded and pointed corner of the felt pad to further blend and soften the darker areas (in the creases and crevices) that you created earlier.<p>
	<center><img src="face painting_12a.jpg" width="278" height="130"></center><br clear="ALL"><br>

	<center><img src="../../bar.gif" width="427" height="32"></center><p>

<img src="face painting_13.jpg" align="left" width="242" height="340">
Add terra cotta shading to the upper right forehead, a bit lighter than the left side. Blend the color in again with the felt pad, as you did on the other side of the face and below the chin.<p>

Eventually your felt pad will collect a lot of pink, peach and brownish colors, and it will become a treasured "shader". My felt shaders have been collecting color for several years and now, I can rub them across a cloth surface to produce a soft rosy glow, without using pencils.<p>

If any of the gel pen lines have faded, redo the lines now using your brown or burgundy pen. Keep the lines visible, but not too dark.<p>

Using a white colored pencil (or if you are feeling extravagant, a white chalk pastel pencil), add highlighting to the areas on the face which would be the highest points, that is, those areas which would likely catch the light first. These areas include: the center of the forehead, the center of the upper eyelids, the middle of the nose and the chin. Color these areas with the white pencil. Darker shades of fabric will allow these white highlights to show better than lighter shades, so be a bit more heavy-handed if your face fabric is pale.<br clear="ALL"><br>

<img src="face painting_14.jpg" align="left" width="239" height="346">
Use a darker rose, magenta or peach pencil to lay color on the cheeks. Create a wide triangle of color low on each cheek, starting back at the side of the head.<br clear="all"><br>

	<center><img src="../../bar.gif" width="427" height="32"></center><p>

<img src="face painting_15.jpg" align="left" width="227" height="321">
Use your felt blending pad and rub the color across the cheek to blend it into the fabric surface. Add a bit of peach or orange as a second layer if the blush looks too pink and blend this in with the felt. Use the same colors and the same technique to put a bit of blush color onto the chin area.<br clear="ALL"><br>

<b>More Eye Detailing</b><p>

<img src="face painting_16.jpg" align="left" width="229" height="325">
Once the eyelid shading has been created and the white highlights are in place, redefine the upper eyelid line with a brown gel pen, or a color that coordinates with the eyeshadow. (e.g. If you used some darker green pencil, you can use a dark green pen here.)<p>

Use a brown or black gel pen to create upper eyelashes. Don't make the eyelashes too long, and don't make them look like spider legs. Use a combination of short and long strokes, and curve these little lashes outwards.<p>

Add lower eyelashes, but make them very short. Extend the line of lower eyelashes only to the center of the iris.<p>
	<center><img src="face painting_16a.jpg" width="301" height="124"></center><br clear="ALL"><br>

	<center><img src="../../bar.gif" width="427" height="32"></center><p>

<img src="face painting_17.jpg" align="left" width="229" height="325">
As a final shadowing effect for the eyes, use a colored pencil that matches your eye color and shade along the lower edge of the UPPER eyelid. Color in an obvious shadow to create a darker area that is suggestive of an overhanging eyelid. This also softens the sometimes stark effect of the whites of the eyes.<p>
	<center><img src="face painting_17a.jpg" width="292" height="132"></center><br clear="ALL"><br>

	<center><img src="../../bar.gif" width="427" height="32"></center><p>

<img src="face painting_18.jpg" align="left" width="240" height="320">
Add a little rose to the shadowed areas that you filled in with the terra cotta pencil. It will coordinate the colors a bit more and not leave the shadows looking quite so brown.<p>

Use your white colored pencil to add soft streaks of white highlighting across the top of the cheeks.<p>

Soften the white streak with the stump blender (check that it's clear of the brown that you were using!)<p>

Go back now and check that all of the lines are as sharp and visible as you would like them to be. Redo any lines that seem to have faded back.<p>

Use a small stick with a sharp point, a toothpick or a pin to apply two small dots of shiny white fabric paint to the eyes. "Scribbles 3-D Fabric Paint" comes in a great "shiny white" that works well for the highlights in the eyes. The white dots must be placed in the same spot in each eye to make it appear that there is a light source which is coming from only one direction.<br clear="ALL"><br>

<b>Protecting the Face</b><p>

When everything has dried and you are happy with the face, spray your artwork with Krylon Workable Fixative, Krylon Final Fixative or any matte finish clear acrylic topcoat. Spray lightly and evenly, and don't soak the fabric. Spray in a well ventilated area, preferably outdoors. Let the face dry well before attaching the head to the body.<p>

If you want to add some magic sparkle to the face, paint some glitter fabric paint along the top of the cheeks and / or just below the eyebrows. This should be done AFTER the final Fixative spray has been applied.<p>
